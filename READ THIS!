DATABASE :
I have created three tables in total, they are :
1.registration table - contains username,ph number ,adhar number ,address and password .
2.user cards table - has username ,card type ,card name ,card pin ,card CVV and card balance 
3. beneficiary table - has username and the beneficiary names .

CODE :
I have divided my code into different files to easily understand the code they are: 
1.home.py - which is the file we run to execute our entire code 
2.registration.py - which is used to register and these details are stored in database .
3.login.py - after registration is done we can login , that code is in this file 
4.carddetails.py - this file is used to enter card details and stores in database .
5.base.py - this stands as a back bone to the entire code , all various functions are here .
6.rough.py - I have used it as a playground to construct this banking application .
